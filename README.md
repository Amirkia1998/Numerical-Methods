# Numerical Methods
A couple of Numerical Methods written in C for a course on Numerical Analysis.


## Description

This project includes a few numerical methods for performing numerical calculations. You can use it to solve nonlinear equations, compute differentiations and integrals, find the inverse of a matrix, solve a system of linear equations, and so on.
